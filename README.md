# React native

> ## Step 1 : (Create expo app)

-   We are going to use `expo-cli`.
-   It is same as `create-react-app` we have in the react-js.
-   It gives us a project structure of our react native application.
-   Type `npm install --global expo-cli` to install `expo-cli` into our machine.
-   After installing `expo-cli`, type `expo init project-name` to create basic structure of our project.
-   Type `npm start` into that project.
-   After this step we will get one tab inside the browser which has one scanner.
-   We have to install the application called `expo` on our Android device.
-   After installing the application we have to open the application and scan the Scanner which we have got after `npm start`.
